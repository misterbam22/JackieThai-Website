        Hey, my name is Jackie Thai. I am currently in my first year at the Univeristy of California, Riverside. Iâ€™m attending school to get a degree in Business Administrations with a minor in Accounting. After college, I plan to study to pass and become a CPA(Certified Proffessioal Accountant). In the past, Iâ€™ve taken a community college class on business, which accounts for BUS10 at UCR. I have also taken many community college classes in general, so much that coupled with my AP courses passed, I had almost 90 units starting. 
<br><br>

         I feel as though while going to thius university, this was the best major for my future aspirations. 
Due to the high acceptance rate of this college, I intially beleived this was going to be bad for my education. I had assumed that the professors, students, and overall culture of campus would be very bad. I was wrong about the professors. Most of the professors should not be generalized by school, more on an individual basis.  . While attending this university, I have taken courses ranging from History, to Economics, along with business courses since I plan to major in business. When I think of students, coupled along with culture, I had heard this school was rumored to be a party school. My roommates had always been going to parties and Iâ€™ve seen many students around school intoxicated, but now that I put more though into it, thatâ€™s a typical college experience. There were many fellow scholars along with the complete opposite. For the culture, when going to the mandatory orientation, they pushed a lot of information about Tartan Soul and school pride, but the campus was very different from what I was told. We are not known for sports, as we rarely win. I never saw people wear face paint, or go to any of the games/matches, and I just felt likew there was a small amount of culture around campus. There was a event in the main belltower area that felt almost weekly. 

A great part of my college experience has been with the UCR gaming club, Highlander Gaming. I had intially joined this club in the summer, and had joined one of the college esports teams. I had officially joined the League of Legends P team. I was very excited to hear this as I had to work even harder for college. Along with balancing schoolwork, I had to also go to practice, communicate with my team, attend games on weekends, and a lot of meetings to fully work together well with my team. 



In the past, Iâ€™ve taken a community college class on business, which accounts for BUS10 at UCR. I have also taken many community college classes in general, so much that coupled with my AP courses passed, I had almost 90 units starting. I had also taken many non credit courses on accounting, and found I was quite good at it. As part of a school project, I had shadowed an accountant that worked at a car dealership nearby. It was quite cool seeing all the different items they had to work on, and I even got to know her creditials and starting salary.This experience has taught me that I wanted to pursue being an accountant and becoming a CPA as that was her recommendatiom.
